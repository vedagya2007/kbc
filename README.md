The Classic Quiz Game, Kaun Banega Crorepati (The Indian version of Who wants to be a Millionaire?).

This is a Classic Quiz Game. 15 Questions will be presented to you one by one. Answer your way to win Rs. 1 Crore, and become a 'Crorepati' (Millionaire).

If you get stuck somewhere, 3 Lifelines are available for your help, which can be used only once during the course of the game. They are '50-50', 'Skip the Question' and 'Audience Poll'.

2 Safezones are there in the game at Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 3,20,000 . If a person incorrectly answers the question, the person drops down and wins the money which was secured at the safezone. At any point, the player can choose to quit the game, and walk out with the
money he has won until then.
